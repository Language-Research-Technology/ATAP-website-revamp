But the rest of the world are bringing with them new approaches to how data is handled. This means that fields such as corpus linguistics may need to reassess their practices. Such reassessment includes addressing concerns about how data is stored and who can access it (data stewardship) – concerns that are a part of the [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) movement, ultimately grounded on principles of equity and accountability. \n\nThe most influential approach to data stewardship today is the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/) principles.\nAccording to these principles, data should be:\n- *Findable* \n<br />\n&emsp; Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. \n- *Accessible*\n<br />\n&emsp; Once the user finds the required data, she/he/they need to know how can they be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.\n- *Interoperable*\n<br />\n&emsp; The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.\n- *Reusable*\n<br />\n&emsp; The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.\n<br /><br />\n\nIn general, corpus linguists do well on the interoperability criterion. Corpus data is usually stored in non-proprietary formats; even when some structure is imposed on the data, this is almost always in a form which is saved as a simple text file (e.g. csv files or xml annotations). Data stored in such formats is easy to move between applications. But what about the other three criteria? \n\nSome corpus data is easy to discover; it is findable. For example CLARIN, the [portal](https://www.clarin.eu/content/data) to the European Union language resource infrastructure, provides access to many large data collections, as does the [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/) in the USA. However, some data is never made part of a large collection and often remains under the control of individual researchers or research teams. Such data may be almost impossible to find. Even if we can find such data, it is unlikely to be accompanied by good descriptions of the data and metadata, making reusability problematic. Of course, big corpora such as the [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/) will be both findable and accompanied by comprehensive corpus manuals. However, it is worth considering how to make other corpora more findable, including the provision of corpus manuals or corpus descriptions. Corpus resource databases such as [CoRD](https://varieng.helsinki.fi/CoRD/) do aim to work towards this principle.\n\nAccessibility may also be an issue for some data. Copyright law may allow use of material for individual research but prohibit any further distribution of the material. The FAIR approach to such cases is that metadata should be available so that interested parties can know that a data holding exists (F), and the metadata will include information about the conditions under which the data may or may not be shared or reused (A and R). \n\n![FAIR and CARE principles](/fair-care.png)\n\nImage from Global Indigenous Data Alliance (https://www.gida-global.org/)\n<br /><br />\nFor linguists, there is another very important set of principles concerning data, the CARE principles developed by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance:\n<br />\n- *Collective Benefit*\n<br />\n&emsp; Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data.\n<br />\n- *Authority to control*\n<br />\n&emsp;Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered.\n<br />\n- *Responsibility*\n<br />\n&emsp;Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit.\n<br />\n- *Ethics*\n<br />\n&emsp;Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.\n\n<br />\nThese principles are presented as applying particularly to Indigenous data, but we believe that researchers should adopt this approach in all cases where the people who participate in our research can be seen to have some moral rights in the information they have contributed. Respecting those moral rights should be demonstrated by recognising the participants’ authority to control how data is used, by seeking to ensure that participants derive benefit from use of the data, and by acting ethically and transparently in our relations with the participants. Deborah Cameron and her colleagues (Cameron et al 1993) raised similar issues almost 20 years ago, arguing that the imbalance of power in the relation between researchers and participants needed to be reduced. The CARE principles continue along this path, but go even further in explicitly returning power to the sources of information. \n\nCorpus data is often written language. We have already mentioned that copyright law is relevant to some such material, and that body of law protects at least some rights for the creators of the material. But corpus linguists also work with other kinds of data such as spoken language (spontaneous or produced as a response to some prompt) or written material produced by research participants according to some protocol. In such cases, ethical research practice should include addressing the issues raised by the CARE principles. Some aspects of this practice will fall under institutional ethics requirements (for example, thinking carefully about what permissions we request on consent forms), but other questions must be part of the relationship between the researcher and the research participants. Corpus linguists working with spoken, computer-mediated, or otherwise particularly sensitive data have been aware of at least some of these issues, but the CARE principles offer an opportunity to go further.\n\nAcquiring data for linguistic research takes effort and often that means money. It is therefore a good use of resources if any data we collect can be used by others. The FAIR principles provide a framework to make sharing and reusing data easier, and applying the CARE principles where relevant helps to ensure that our research has a sound ethical basis.\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n<br />\n\nNote: This post is based on the presentation ‘Advance Australia FAIR’,  given by Simon Musgrave and Michael Haugh to the 4th Forum on Englishes in Australia (LaTrobe University, August 27, 2021). \n\n<br />\n\nThanks to Leah Gustafson and Monika Bednarek for helpful comments on drafts.\n\n<br />\n\n**Reference:**\nCameron, Deborah, Elizabeth Frazer, Penelope Harvey, Ben Rampton & Kay Richardson. 1993.

Part 2 also includes a discussion of how the information collected here might shape our view of what ATAP can be.\n\n\n\n\nNote 1: Unfortunately, we confined our survey to English-language resources; and with a focus on the Notebook medium, our analysis is biassed to (but not exclusively) the Python programming language.\n\n\n\n\n"},{"title":"Textbooks, tutorials and tool chests: different ways to learn from notebooks - Part 2","slug":"notebooks-part-2","tags":["Jupyter","notebooks","text analysis"],"content":"# Textbooks, tutorials and tool chests: different ways to learn from notebooks - Part 2\n### More genres of notebooks and what it all means for ATAP\n\n### Written by Joel Nothman\n#### This work was supported by the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/research/facilities/sydney-informatics-hub.html), a Core Research Facility of the University of Sydney\n\n[Part 1](/posts/notebooks-part-1) of this post introduced notebooks in general and identified various broad genres of notebook which have been used in providing text analytic tools. That part looked at notebooks as tutorials and the grouping of such materials into courses or textbooks. In this part, we look at notebooks which introduce individual tools and notebooks which present research results. The post ends with a consideration of how our analysis of different genres of notebook might influence the design of ATAP.\n\n### Libraries and tool chests\n\nA “course” comes with a sense of order and completeness; a “tutorial” with a sense of guidance and demonstration. Some notebook collections appear more designed for reference or application than teaching, as if each notebook was a tool you could take from a chest and utilise for your needs.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td><b>Genre</b></td><td>TOOLKIT</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Typical Structure</b></td><td>(Idealised! There are few examples of this done thoroughly.)<ul><li>Pointers to background reading</li>\n<li>How to load data</li>\n<li>How to set parameters</li>\n<li>Apply method</li>\n<li>Validate results</li>\n<li>Questions to consider</li>\n<li>Analyse results</li>\n<li>Save output</li></ul>\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Strengths</b></td><td>Oriented around decision making, critical application, multiple pathways or uses, and iterative improvement of methods.\n\nMeaningful scope for each notebook.\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Weaknesses</b></td><td>Some processing steps will be optional, notebooks are not very suitable for.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Example</b></td><td><a href='https://nbviewer.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/pm-transcripts/blob/master/harvest_transcripts.ipynb'>GLAM Workbench - Harvest Transcripts</a></td></tr>\n</table>\n\nA notable collection in this space is Tim Sherratt’s [GLAM Workbench](https://glam-workbench.net/). Tim often titles a directory of notebooks as “tools, tips and examples”, which nicely summarises the mix of content that users can retrieve from the Workbench. “Tools” might include a [notebook for acquiring Australian parliament’s Hansard transcripts](https://nbviewer.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/australian-commonwealth-hansard/blob/master/Harvesting-Commonwealth-Hansard.ipynb), offering parameters that the user might change for their own project; or an [app that summarises query results](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/blob/master/querypic.ipynb) from the National Library of Australia’s [Trove](https://trove.nla.gov.au/). An app, here, is distinguished by providing interactive widgets within a notebook, rather than expecting the user to set parameters in code and hit “run”. “Examples” includes a [case study](https://nbviewer.org/github/GLAM-Workbench/ozglam-workbench-naa-wap/blob/master/RecordSearch/2.%20Analyse%20a%20series.ipynb) of filtering a corpus by its metadata, while a [walkthrough on language detection](https://github.com/GLAM-Workbench/trove-newspapers/blob/master/find-non-english-newspapers.ipynb) applied to Trove incorporates many “tips” which help to identify the author’s thinking as his code takes each turn. Case studies like these lie on a spectrum between the genericity of tutorials often applied to demonstration or toy data, and the hypothesis-driven specificity of a research article. Grounding a topic in research use cases may help to evoke a sense of relevance to the user.\n\n<table>\n<tr><td><b>Genre</b></td><td>APP</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Typical Structure</b></td><td><ul><li>Enter parameters / upload data</li>\n<li>See analysis</li>\n<li>Interact</li>\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Strengths</b></td><td>User friendly way to analyse text.\n\nNotebooks enable rapid development of tools.\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Weaknesses</b></td><td>Discourages understanding of the internal workings.

Until recently, Ithaka’s [Constellate.org](https://constellate.org/) – a core part of TAPI – included tutorial notebooks, and corresponding editions of the same notebook “for research”. (Here’s a [tutorial](https://github.com/ithaka/tdm-notebooks/blob/ea3c48e0094303a7d40dec4890c6cfdca275d22b/finding-significant-terms.ipynb) and [research](https://github.com/ithaka/tdm-notebooks/blob/ea3c48e0094303a7d40dec4890c6cfdca275d22b/finding-significant-terms-for-research.ipynb) pair on finding key terms in a corpus.) Each “research” notebook omits some of the guidance included in the tutorial, and was rather intended to be applied to a user-supplied dataset. The removal of these applied notebooks notwithstanding, it appears that the Constellate tutorials should dually function as reusable tools. The Constellate platform allows the user to create a corpus from JSTOR content, and select a tutorial/tool notebook from their collection, which is then applied to the new corpus. An important usability feature of reusable tools, and tutorials with this capability, is how they guide or support the user to apply the notebook to their own data.\n\nAlthough targeting experienced corporate data scientists, rather than HASS researchers, data infrastructure provider Databricks openly publishes another relevant tool chest of notebooks (albeit not designed for the Jupyter platform). Their [Solution Accelerators](https://databricks.com/solutions/accelerators) are designed to support a fairly code-savvy analyst in tackling standard data science problems in industry. (Read “Solution Accelerator” as a less patronising, more businessy, revamp of the term “starter kit”.) A Solution Accelerator notebook mixes narrative and code, inviting the user to bring their own data. It may give them data transformation code, models to apply, questions to ask, and diagnostics to perform. The library of Solution Accelerators shows how even a capable user may appreciate a notebook as a launchpad when working with new techniques. The apparent value of Solution Accelerators to Databricks customers highlights the risk and cost of undertaking analysis without workflow guidance from a notebook.\n\nUnlike tutorials, a notebook tool chest does not make great efforts to build up a user’s skills from scratch, but supports them in selecting a tool that might be appropriate, seeing its relevance, and applying it to their needs.\n\n### Journals and Anthologies\n\nThrough their mix of code, narrative and generated tables and figures, notebooks are a powerful tool for presenting reproducible experimental results. A research paper implemented as a notebook may be rebuilt from its code, reproducing tables, figures and examples as the researcher modifies it. An article-as-notebook is distinguished by its focus on a specific research question, and application of whichever tools are appropriate to draw reliable conclusions. Although individual humanities researchers using digital methods might publish their research as code notebooks (see Quinn Dombrowski’s [list](https://github.com/quinnanya/dh-jupyter#research--projects) for instance), institutional or discipline-specific collections of research notebooks are not yet common in applied text analysis and HASS. For comparison, a move towards reproducibility in other sciences allows one to find a multitude of research notebooks in venues like [paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/) and [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/explore/capsules).\n\n<table>\n<tr><td><b>Genre</b></td><td>RESEARCH EXPERIMENT</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Typical Structure</b></td><td><ul><li>Introduction</li>\n<li>Preparation</li>\n<li>Repeat for each tool or step:\n\nModelling, Analysis, Interpretation</li>\n<li>Discussion</li></ul>\n\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Strengths</b></td><td>Demonstrates application of tools to answer a question.\n\nDemonstrates combination of tools.\n\nEncourages reuse, reproducibility and open science.\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Weaknesses</b></td><td>May not support the reader to adopt the techniques.</td></tr>\n<tr><td><b>Example</b></td><td><a href='https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/en/article/4yxHGiqXYRbX'>Topic Specific Corpus Building</a></td></tr>\n</table>\n\nWhen driven by a research question, the notebook author is less interested in demonstrating what techniques are *available* to apply, and more selective in using techniques that may helpfully harness their data towards a specific goal or narrative. The research thesis thus provides a way to specifically evaluate the output of an analysis: does it support a hypothesis? does it induce a new hypothesis? does it suggest problems in the modelling? The final research notebook may hide aspects of this iterative experimentation, evaluation, and the response of further investigation, issue mitigation, or discarding a path of investigation. (The ideal reproducible research notebook would keep track of dead ends too!)\nTutorials and tools may emulate these processes of iterative development, or provide a range of possible pathways for analysis; the research notebook, however, must keep its focus on the thesis being explored.\n\nThe [Journal of Digital History](https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/) is a new player in this space, releasing its first issue in October 2021. This project of the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History and De Gruyter ensures some reproducibility by requiring the code which constructs the research article to be executable and its data available to reproduce tables and figures, while allowing the reader to evaluate and reuse the research implementation. It goes further in harnessing the notebook medium to add layers of depth to peer-reviewed publications in digital history: viewing a JDH publication, a reader is able to hide what they call the “hermeneutic layer” of the work, which provides methodological detail, as distinct from the narrative arc of the research. The notebook medium applied in this way is able to shift several paradigms about how research is constructed, presented, and accessed.\n\n### Bringing it back to users\n\nIn positioning the Australian Text Analytics Platform’s role amidst ongoing and past resource creation, we have to consider how our library of notebooks might build outcomes for our users. Here are some outcomes we are considering.\n\n#### Reference and Application\n- User has access to starters’ kits for a wide range of techniques, covering data modelling, validation and analysis, archiving, etc.\n- User can experiment with standard tools applied to demo data or their own.\n- User can adapt code notebooks to their own use cases.\n- User is able to compare alternative methods for similar goals.\n\n#### Growth and Learning\n- User is familiar with what selected research methods look like as code.\n- User is familiar with what end-to-end research looks like as code.\n- User can prepare their own data for existing or standard tools.\n- User understands how their research problem might translate to a computational problem, and the applicable techniques.\n- User is able to combine multiple techniques to achieve their research goals.\n- User understands how to build good research software.\n- User can confidently build a notebook from scratch for their own research.\n\nWe also need to define who our user personas are: is it someone with academic expertise, but little in code? or someone with moderate code literacy, but stuck with how to create notebooks for reproducible research? The latter might be more interested in published starter kits, case studies and experiments, while the former needs the guidance provided by a tutorial.\n\n### Where to from here?\n\nBy surveying several collections of notebooks for text analytics, we have a stronger understanding of the spectrum of materials ATAP’s library can incorporate, both in content and in genre.\n\nOne apparent opportunity is to curate or improve a catalogue of existing resources that will meet the needs of the Australian text analytics research community. It’s also possible to see areas where existing resources may fail to meet the needs of current users of desktop and web tools for corpus analysis from [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) to [AntConc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/); those tools provide interactivity that carries the user across views of statistics, query matches and texts, but tend to be limited in facilitated reproducible research and in extensibility to arbitrary corpus cleaning and analysis procedures. Tying the resources we’ve looked at to user outcomes also gives a better understanding how to evaluate accessibility of a notebook and the learning opportunities arising from it, such as to what extent a resource:\n- supports the user getting their own data into the notebook.\n- demonstrates the combination of multiple techniques into research.\n- helps a researcher choose techniques relevant to their research question.\n- supports the user to experiment with the code of the notebook\n- demonstrates the processes and challenges around using/applying a technique and the code needed to implement those decisions e.g. decisions to make before and after applying topic models. \n\nOverall, we’ve talked little about how notebooks present their content, and how that presentation might affect user engagement and the sustainability of the resource. Of course, those concerns are also important in looking at principles for quality in notebook resources for digital humanities and other text analytics users.\n\n"}],"pages":[{"title":"Preparing Text Data","slug":"data_prep","content":"\n### Introducing data preparation concepts \n\n<figure>\n  <img\n    src=\"data-prep-approach-time.png\" \n    alt=\"What data scientists spend the most time doing - pie chart\"  \n  />\n  <figcaption align = \"center\"><b>What data scientists spend the most time doing - pie chart</b></figcaption>\n</figure>\n \nThis graphic is, sadly, all too true. Data scientists and those who are using \ndata as part of their research spend much of their time preparing their \ndataset and transforming its structure into a format that can be used (often \nreferred to as [data wrangling](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-wrangling)\nor data munging). The Australian Text Analytics Platform will offer a range \nof tools to assist in cleaning text data and performing other preliminary \noperations which can prepare the data for analysis. ATAP analysis notebooks \nassume a common data structure, however the platform will provide notebooks \ncontaining code for transforming data into the structure that is needed for \nthe procedure(s) in the analysis notebooks.\n\nThere are two main processes that are needed to prepare text data for analysis\n, [cleaning](#common-cleaning-techniques) and [annotation](#annotation), and \nthe ones that you will need to use will depend on the dataset that you are \nusing. \n\n### Common Cleaning Techniques\n- **Making all of the text lower case:**\n  This ensures that e.g. *dog* and *Dog* will not be treated as different items\n  and is important if you are going to use analytic methods which rely on \n  counting items. However, if you are planning to extract entities from your \n  text data, retaining capital letters may be important.\n\n- **Standardising spelling:**\n  At least for English text, there are some well-known spelling variations, \n  some with a geographical context (*colour/color*) and some that are more a \n  matter of personal preference (*recognise/recognize*). As with case, \n  standardising spelling ensures that pairs like the examples are treated as \n  tokens of the same type.\n\n- **Removing stopwords:**\n  Stopwords are function words that are not interesting for many analyses and \n  we can safely remove them from our data using a stoplist. The 20 most \n  frequently occurring words in the \n  [British National Corpus](https://www.english-corpora.org/bnc/) are *the, of\n  , and, a, in, to, it, is, was, to, I, for, you, he, be, with, on, that, by\n  *, and *at*. The equivalent list for the Corpus of Contemporary American \n  English ([COCA](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/)) is *the, be, and, of\n  , a, in, to, have, to, it, I, that, for, you, he, with, on, do, say* and *\n  this*. \n  Some of the differences between the two are because the COCA counts are of \n  lemmas (see Lemmatization below) which are the base forms of a word (think *\n  dog* and *dogs*). Packages such as [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/) and \n  [spaCy  ](https://spacy.io/) include standard stoplists for various \n  languages, and it is possible to specify other words to be excluded.\n\n- **Removing punctuation:**\n  Punctuation can change how a text analysis package identifies a word. For \n  instance to be sure that *dog* and *dog?* are not treated as different items,\n  removing punctuation is good practice.\n\n- **Removing numbers:** \n  Sometimes the presence of numbers in documents can lead to artefacts in \n  analysis. For example, in a collection of documents with page numbering, \n  the numbers might show up as collocates of words or as part of a topic in a \n  topic model. To avoid this, removing numbers is also good practice. This \n  can present a challenge where numbers might be of interest (e.g. a study of \n  mathematics textbooks).\n\n- **Removing whitespace:** \n  Whitespace can be another possible source of artefacts in analysis, \n  especially if the source material uses a lot of tabs.\n\n### Annotation\nAnnotation is the process of adding information to your base dataset in order \nto make it possible to apply analytic techniques. In some cases, this may be \na manual process. For example, much of the annotation which is described in \nthe Text Encoding Initiative [Guidelines](https://tei-c.org/guidelines/) \nrequires a human making decisions although, in some cases, manual annotation \nprocesses may also be scaled up to large text corpora using text \nclassification or information extraction technologies. \n\nHowever some annotation can be carried out automatically, and there are two \nimportant kinds of annotation for text which fall into this category.\n\n\n- **Part-of-speech tagging (POS-tagging):** \n  For some analytic procedures, knowing the part of speech (or class of words) \n  that an item belongs to is important. For languages where good pre-trained \n  models exist, this annotation can be carried out automatically to a high \n  level of accuracy – for English, we expect an accuracy rate better than 95%. \n  POS-taggers generally provide more information than just whether an item is a \n  noun or a verb, they also distinguish singular and plural forms of nouns and \n  tell us whether a verb’s form is present tense form or a past tense. The tag \n  sets which are used can therefore be quite extensive, and there are various \n  tag sets in use such as the \n  [Penn Treebank](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html)\n  tags and the [CLAWS](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws5tags.html) tags used by \n  the British National Corpus.\n\n[LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/) has some excellent resources that \ndiscuss POS tagging in more detail.\n\n- **Lemmatization:** \n  The distinctions between different forms of a single lexeme can be a \n  hindrance in analysis especially if we are interested in lexical semantics in \n  texts. Lemmatization identifies the base forms of words (or lemmas) in a text \n  so that all forms of an item are treated together. For example: *dog* and *dogs* \n  will both be instances of the lemma DOG. *eat, eats, eating* and *ate* \n  will all be treated as tokens of the lemma EAT. \n  As noted above, POS-tags give information about the form of words and are \n  generally part of the annotation in lemmatization. A lemma, along with a POS-\n  tag, can be reconstructed to the original form if \n  necessary.\n"},{"title":"Events","slug":"events","content":"# Events\n\n[Webinars](#webinars) &emsp;&emsp;\n[Forthcoming workshops](#forthcoming-workshops) &emsp;&emsp;\n[Previous workshops](#previous-workshops) &emsp;&emsp;\n[Office Hours](#office-hours)\n\n### Webinars {#webinars}\n\nOur webinar series is a joint initiative with the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory ([LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)), (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Queensland).

Since September 2021 she is also a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the [Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh). Before joining the Turing, she was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature. Her research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. She works on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). Her interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic.\n\n[Zoom link](https://uqz.zoom.us/j/83999047730?from=addon)\n\n#### August 1 2022 - Václav Cvrček: The Czech national Corpus\n[Václav Cvrček](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/institute/people/vaclav-cvrcek-2/) is a linguist who deals with the description of the Czech language, especially with the use of large electronic corpora and quantitative methods.

As part of this project, we have adapted with permission a Quotation Tool, developed by the Discourse Processing Lab at Simon Fraser University.\n\nThe Quotation tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to extract quotes from large (or small) text datasets, all from the comfort of a web browser. The tool can identify from the sentence \"Apple said that Tim Cook will be in Australia next month.\" the phrase \"Tim Cook will be in Australia next month\" as the quote and \"Apple\" as the speaker. It also allows users to extract and visualise additional information right in the web browser, including identifying named entities affiliated with the speakers and in the quotes themselves, such as \"Apple\", \"Tim Cook\" and \"Australia\" in the above example. The tool supports saving the results locally for further analysis, enabling you to gain meaningful insights into your research questions.\n\nThis 1-hour online workshop will be of interest to researchers and HDR students in Linguistics, Business, Law and Science and others who are interested in working with text datasets - no background knowledge of NLP or coding experience is required.\n\nYou can BYO a small dataset (10-15 texts, stored as one text per file or all texts compressed in a zip file) – or use one of our sample datasets to get started.\n\nThe workshop is presented by the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/o/sydney-informatics-hub-core-research-facilities-dvcr-the-university-of-sydney-10505148868).\n\n**Date**: September 8 2022 <br>\n**Time**: 12:00 - 13:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time <br>\n**[Details and Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/finding-quotes-and-speakers-in-text-using-the-atap-quotation-tool-tickets-396309952737)** \n\n#### Showcasing Approaches to Digital Humanities for Researchers: Advance care planning for your research data\n\nSometimes research projects can feel never ending, but in fact most projects do have a finish point (such as submitting a thesis). What then happens to the data collected in the project? This workshop starts from that question, invites participants to consider possible answers and then to think about the implications for their current data management practices. We consider the practical, ethical, and technical dimensions of managing research data after the project ends to help participants to start planning for the future of their data.\n\nThe workshop is presented by the [FAVeR](https://faver.edu.au/).\n\n**Date**: September 7 2022 <br>\n**Time**: 12:00 - 13:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time <br>\n**[Details and Registration](https://faver.edu.au/event/advance-care-planning-for-your-research-data/)** \n\n#### Computational Thinking in the Humanities\n\nThe workshop Computational Thinking in the Humanities is a 3-hour online workshop featuring two plenary talks, lightning presentations, as well as a panel discussion.

We also have given references to published research using the methods we discuss.\n\nLADAL has an overview of [text analysis and distant reading](https://slcladal.github.io/textanalysis.html). \n\n\n\n### Counting Words {#counting-words}\n\n#### Word frequency\n\nKnowing how frequently words occur in a text can already give us information about that text and frequency lists based on large corpora are a useful tool in themselves - you can [download](https://kilgarriff.co.uk/bnc-readme.html) such lists for the (original) [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/).\n\nTracking changes in the frequency of use of words across time has become popular since Google’s [n-gram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) has been available. However, results from this tool have to treated with caution for reasons set out in this [blog-post](https://broadstreet.blog/2021/08/11/bad-ngrams/). \n\nComparing patterns of word frequency across texts can be part of authorship attribution. Patrick Juola [describes using this method](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5315) when he tried to decide whether Robert Galbraith was really J.K Rowling.\n\n\nThis paper uses frequency and concordance analysis, with Australian data:\n\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Bednarek, Monika. 2020. Invisible or high-risk: Computer-assisted discourse analysis of references to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people(s) and issues in a newspaper corpus about diabetes. <i>PLoS ONE</i> 15/6: e0234486. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234486\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234486</a> </font></div>\n\n\nThe ratio of types and tokens in a text has been used as a measure of lexical diversity in developmental and clinical studies as well as in stylistics. It has also been applied to theoretical problems in linguistics:\n\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Kettunen, Kimmo. 2014. Can Type-Token Ratio be Used to Show Morphological Complexity of Languages? <i>Journal of Quantitative Linguistics</i> 21(3). 223–245. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/09296174.2014.911506\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1080/09296174.2014.911506</a>.</font></div>\n\n\n#### Concordance\nA concordance allows the researcher to see all instances of a word or phrase in a text, neatly aligned in a column and with preceding and following context (see image below).\nConcordances are often a first step in analysis. The concordance allows a researcher to see how a word is used and in what contexts. Most concordancing tools allow sorting of results by either preceding or following words – the coloured text in the example below shows that in this case the results have been sorted hierarchically on the three following words. This possibility can help in discovering patterns of co-occurrence. Concordances are also very useful when looking for good examples to illustrate a point. (The type of display seen in the example is often referred to as KeyWord In Context – KWIC. There is a possibility of confusion here, as there is a separate analytic method commonly referred to as [Keywords](#keywords).)\n\n![Example of a concordance](/concordance.png)\n\n(The example here was produced by [Antconc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/)) \n\nThis [tutorial](https://slcladal.github.io/kwics.html) from LADAL on concordancing uses a notebook containing R code as a method of extracting concordance data.\n\n\n\n\n#### Clusters and collocations\nTwo methods can be used for counting the co-occurrence of items in text. \nClusters (sometimes known as n-grams) are sequences of adjacent items. A bigram is a sequence of two items, a trigram (3-gram) is a sequence of three items and so on. n-grams are types made up of more than one item, and therefore we can count the number of tokens of each n-gram in texts. n-grams are also the basis for a class of language models. (Google created a very large data set of English n-grams in developing their language-based algorithms and this [data is available](https://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv3.html).)\nCollocations are patterns of co-occurrence in which the items are not necessarily adjacent. An example of why this is important is verbs and their objects in English. The object of a verb is a noun phrase and in many cases the first item in an English noun phrase is a determiner. This means that for many transitive verbs, the bigram *verb the* will occur quite frequently. But it is much more interesting to know whether there are patterns relating verbs and the entities which are their objects. \nCollocation analysis uncovers such patterns by looking at co-occurrences within a window of a certain size, for example three tokens on either side of the target. Collocation analysis gives information about the frequency of the co-occurrence of words and also a statistical measure of how likely that frequency is, given the overall frequencies of the terms in the corpus. Measures commonly applied include [Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) scores and [Log-Likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Log-likelihood) scores.\nCollocations can also tell us about the meanings of words. If a word has collocates which fall into semantically distinct groups, this can indicate ambiguity or polysemy. And if different words share patterns of collocation, this can be evidence that the words are at least partial synonyms. \n\nThis graphic shows collocation relations in Darwin’s Origin of Species visualised as a network - the likelihood of a pair of words occurring in close proximity in the text is indicated by the weight of the line linking them:\n\n![Collocation patterns in *Origin of Species* as a network](/collocation_network.png)\n\nThis article uses bigram frequencies as part of an analysis of language change:\n\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Schweinberger, Martin. 2021.

It tells us which words are more frequent (or less frequent) than would be expected in one text compared to another text and gives an estimate of the probability of the result. Keyword analysis uses two corpora: a **target** corpus, which is the material of interest, and a **comparison** corpus. Frequency lists are made for each corpus and then frequency of individual types in each corpus are compared. Keywords are ones which occur more ( or less) frequently in the target corpus than expected given the reference corpus. \nThe **keyness** of individual items is a quantitative measure of how unexpected the frequency is; chi-square is a one possible measure of this, but a log-likelihood measure is more commonly used. Positive keywords are words which occur more commonly than expected; negative keywords are words which occur less commonly than expected.\n\nThis visualisation shows a comparison of positive distinguishing words for three texts (Charles Darwin’s *Origin*, Herman Melville’s *Moby Dick*, and George Orwell’s *1984*), words that occur more commonly than we expect in one text when taking the other two texts as a comparison: \n\n![Keywords from three texts](/keywords.png)\n\nThis paper applies keyword analysis to Australian text data sourced from a television series script:\n\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Bednarek, Monika. 2020.

For example, a document (or a portion of a document) can be classified as having positive or negative sentiment. These methods are all examples of supervised machine learning. An algorithm is trained on the basis of annotated data to identify classifiers in the data – features which correlate in some way with the annotated classifications. If the algorithm achieves good results on testing data (classified by human judgment), then it can be used to classify unannotated data.\n\n\n\n#### Document Classification\nThe task here is to assign documents to categories automatically. An everyday example of this procedure is spam filtering of email that may be applied by internet service providers and also within email applications. An example of this technique being used in research would be automatically identifying historical court records as referring either to violent crimes, property offences, or other crimes. \n\nThe following two articles taken together give an account of a technique for partially automating the training phase of classification and then of how the classifiers allowed researchers to access new information in a large and complex text.\n\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Leavy, Susan, Mark T Keane & Emilie Pine. 2019.

In simple cases, this can mean sorting documents into those which a express a positive view and those which express a negative view (with a neutral position sometimes also included). Such classifications are the basis for aggregated ratings - for example, online listings of movies and restaurants. A sentiment value is assigned to individual reviews then an aggregate score is calculated based on those values and that aggregate score is the rating presented to the user. More sophisticated sentiment analysis can assign values on a scale. Some sentiment analysis tools use dictionaries of terms with sentiment values assigned to those terms; these are known as pre-trained or pre-determined classifiers.\n\nThe following figure shows the results of the sentiment analysis of four texts (*The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* by Mark Twain, *1984* by George Orwell, *The Colour out of Space* by H.P.Lovecraft, and *On the Origin of Species* by Charles Darwin) using the Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (Mohammad and Turney 2013). The graphic shows what percentage of each text can be assigned to each of eight categories of sentiment:\n \n![Sentiment analysis of four texts](/sentiment_analysis.png)\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for [Sentiment Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) gives more information and examples particularly in relation to the use of sentiment analysis as a tool used in online settings. \n\nLADAL’s [Sentiment Analysis tutorial](https://slcladal.github.io/sentiment.html) uses a notebook containing R code as a method of performing sentiment analysis.\n\nThis article discusses problems in assembling training data for complex sentiment analysis tasks and then applies the results to oral history interviews with Holocaust survivors:\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Blanke, Tobias, Michael Bryant & Mark Hedges. 2020.

First, segments of text are classified as either denoting or not denoting an entity: for example, a person, a place or an organization. The identified entities can then be classified as belonging to one of the types of entity.\n\nThe Wikipedia entry explaining [named-entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) gives further detail about the technique.\n\nThis article looks at the problems encountered when applying a well-known entity recognition package ([Stanford](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html)) to historical newspapers in the National Library of Australia’s Trove collection:\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Mac Kim, Sunghwan & Steve Cassidy. 2015.

(<a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/U15-1007.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">pdf</a>)</font></div>\n\nThis article (section 6.3) discusses why entity recognition is not as useful as might be expected when studying names in novels:\n\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Dalen-Oskam, K. van. 2013. Names in novels: An experiment in computational stylistics. <i>Literary and Linguistic Computing</i> 28(2). 359–370. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqs007\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqs007</a>.</font></div>\n\n\n\n#### Computational Stylistics (Stylometry) \nThis method is also referred to as authorship attribution as the classification task is to assess patterns of language use in order to decide whether to attribute a piece of text to a particular author (and with what degree of confidence). Seemingly simple classifiers are used for this task as they are assumed to be less open to conscious manipulation by writers. For example, comparative patterns of occurrence of function words such as *the* and *a/an* are considered a better classifier than occurrences of content words. Character n-grams, that is sequences of characters of a specified length, have also proven to be a good classifier for use in this task. A recent example of these techniques being applied in a case which received a good deal of public attention was the controversy about whether [Robert Galbraith was really J.K Rowling](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5315).\n\nThe Wikipedia entry on [stylometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylometry) gives further information on the methodology. \n\n\n\nThis article applies stylometric techniques to a classic of Chinese literature:\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Zhu, Haoran, Lei Lei & Hugh Craig. 2021.

The underlying assumption is that different topics will tend to be associated with different words, different documents will tend to be associated with different topics, and therefore the distribution of words across documents allows us to find topics. The complete model includes the strength of association (or probability) between each word and each topic, and between each topic and each document. A topic consists of a group of words and it is up to the researcher to decide if a semantically coherent interpretation can be given to any of the topics recovered. The number of topics to be recovered is specified in advance.\n\nThe example visualisation below is based on topic modeling of the State of the Union addresses given by US presidents, and shows the relative importance of different topics over time. In the right hand part of the figure, the words most closely linked to each topic are listed; the researcher has not attempted to give labels to these (although in some cases, it is not too hard to imagine what labels we might use). Note also that words are not uniquely linked to topics - for example, the word *state* is closely linked to seven of the topics in this model.\n \n![Topics in the State of the Union Address over time](/topic_models.png)\n\nThe Wikipedia entry for [topic models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model) gives a more detailed explanation of the process.\n\nThis [topic modeling tutorial](https://slcladal.github.io/topicmodels.html) from LADAL uses R coding to process textual data and generate a topic model from that data.\n\n<i>Poetics</i> 41(6) is a journal issue devoted to the use of topic models in literary studies: the introduction to the journal (by Mohr and Bogdanov: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2013.10.001</a>) provides a useful overview of the method.\n\nAnd this paper uses topic modeling as one tool in trying to improve access to a huge collection of scholarly literature:\n\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Mimno, David. 2012.

Analysis of social networks is a classic application of the method, but words and documents can also be thought of as entities and the relationships between them can then be analysed with this method. (see example visualisation of Darwin’s *Origin of Species* above)\nHere is another example of a network graph illustrating the relationships between the characters of Shakespeare’s *Romeo and Juliet*:\n\n![Network of characters in Romeo and Juliet](/network_RandJ-1.png)\n\nThis article gives several examples of how representing collocational links between words as a network can lead to insight into meaning relations:\n<div class=\"reference\"><font size=\"3\">Brezina, Vaclav, Tony McEnery & Stephen Wattam. 2015.

It also introduces computational methods such as web scraping, APIs, topic modeling, Named Entity Recognition (NER), network analysis, and mapping.\n\n<br />\n\n[Text Analysis Pedagogy Institute](https://labs.jstor.org/tapi/) is an open educational institute for the benefit of teachers (and aspiring teachers) of text analysis in the digital humanities.\n\n<br />\n\n[The Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/) publishes novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate research and teaching.\n\n<br />\n\n[Quinn Dombrowski's list of relevant courses and tutorials](https://github.com/quinnanya/dh-jupyter)\nA collection of Jupyter notebooks in many human and computer languages for doing digital humanities. \n"},{"title":"Text Analysis Overview","slug":"text_analysis","content":"# Text Analysis Overview\n\n### Understanding Text as Data\n\nMany definitions of *data* include an element such as *individual items of information*. If we consider *text* to include any sort of language in use, covering different modalities (spoken, written signed) and different extents (from individual sounds to multi-volume books), then fitting text to this definition requires some abstraction. We have to define some unit or units of analysis and we can then treat each of those units as an individual item of information. Examples of such units include documents, sentences and words. But *word* is not as simple a unit as you may think.\n\n### What's in a word?\n\nThe term *word* is problematic. It is well-known to linguists that phonological words (defined by sound patterns), syntactic words (defined by combinatorial possibilities) and orthographic words (defined by the conventions of a writing system) do not always coincide. And even when we are only looking at written material, there are problems. How many words are there in this sentence?\n<center><em>The cat sat on the mat</em></center>\n\nOne answer is that there are six words; that is, there are six groups of characters which are separated according to typographical convention. But there is another answer: There are five words, that is five distinct sequences of characters and one of those sequences (*the*) occurs twice. The terms standardly used to make this distinction are **type** and **token**. **Tokens** are instances of **types**, therefore if we count tokens, we count without considering repetition, while if we count types, we do consider repetition. In our example, there are five types (*the, cat, sat, on, mat*) but six tokens, because there are two tokens of one of the types (*the*).\n\nThere is a further distinction we may need to make which we can see if we consider another question:\n\n<center>Are <i>cat</i> and <i>cats</i> the same word?</center>\n\nThey are distinct types, and therefore must also be distinct as tokens. But we have an intuition that at some level they are related, that there is some more abstract item which underlies both of them. This concept is usually referred to as a **lemma** (there is more about this concept on the [Data Preparation](../data_prep) page).\n\n### Text Analysis Workflow\nThis brief introduction to text analysis divides the process into three parts. In the first stage, the text is made into data. It is divided into the units appropriate for the analysis to be carried out and shaped to a format which our analytic tools can work with. The second stage is the analysis proper, including its interpretation. A wide range of analytic methods can be used, and we give a survey of some of the commonly used possibilities. Finally, our data, methods and results can be documented and packaged as a **research object** which can be stored and reused.\n\n[Data Preparation](../data_prep) &emsp;&emsp; [Useful Methods](../methods) &emsp;&emsp; [Research Objects](../research_objects)\n"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
