### Webinars {#webinars}

Our webinar series is a joint initiative with the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory ([LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)), (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Queensland). LADAL sponsored [webinars](https://slcladal.github.io/webinars2022.html) take place in the alternate months.

All webinars take place at 8:00PM Brisbane time which is UTC+10. Zoom links will be available one week prior to the event.

#### 4 April 2022 - Keoni Mahelona: A practical approach to Indigenous data sovereignty
Keoni Mahelona is the Chief Technical Officer of [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/) where he is a part of the team developing the Kaitiakitanga Licence. This licence seeks to balance the importance of publicly accessible data with the reality that indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public data. By simply opening access to data and knowledge, indigenous people could be further colonised and taken advantage of in a digital, modern world. Therefore Keoni is committed to devising data governance regimes which enable Indigenous people to reclaim and maintain sovereignty over indigenous data.

#### June 6 2022 - Barbara McGillivray: The *Journal of Open Humanities Data*
Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and Editor in Chief of the [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/). Since September 2021 she is also a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the [Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh). Before joining the Turing, she was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature. Her research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. She works on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). Her interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic.

#### August 1 2022 - Václav Cvrček: The Czech national Corpus
[Václav Cvrček](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/institute/people/vaclav-cvrcek-2/) is a linguist who deals with the description of the Czech language, especially with the use of large electronic corpora and quantitative methods. In 2013-2016 he worked as the director of the [Czech National Corpus](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/) project, since 2016 he has been the deputy director. Recently, he has been focusing on research on textual variability and corpus-based discourse analysis with a focus on online media.

#### October 3 2022 - Paweł Kamocki: [topic tba]
Paweł Kamocki is a legal expert in Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim. He studied linguistics and law, and in 2017 obtained his doctorate in law from the universities of Paris and Münster for a thesis on legal aspects of data-intensive university research, with a focus on Knowledge Commons. He worked as a research and teaching assistant at the Paris Descartes university (now: Université de Paris), then also in the private sector. He is certified to work as an attorney in France. An active member of the [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) community since 2012, he currently chairs the CLARIN Legal and Ethical Issues Committee. He also worked with other projects and initiatives in the field of research data policy (RDA, EUDAT) and co-created several LegalTech tools for researchers. One of his main research interests are legal issues in Machine Translation.

### Forthcoming workshops {#forthcoming-workshops}

#### Learn how to collect and analyse comments on YouTube videos using the open-source tools Youte and Discursis

This online workshop is offered free to Australian researchers and research students and will cover:

- Collecting data from YouTube using Youte
- Analysing comments on YouTube videos using Discursis

Brought to you by the teams at the Australian Digital Observatory ([ADO](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/)) and the Australian Text Analytics Platform ([ATAP](https://www.atap.edu.au/)) via the Australian Research Data Commons ([ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/)).

**Date**: September 21 2022 <br>
**Time**: 09:00 - 12:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time <br>
**[Details and Registration](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/collecting-and-analysing-youtube-video-comments-using-youte-and-discursis-registration-405976726317)** 


#### Finding quotes and speakers in text using the ATAP quotation tools

The Australian Text Analytics Platform (ATAP) project is a project that aims to provide researchers with the tools and training for analysing, processing, and exploring text. As part of this project, we have adapted with permission a Quotation Tool, developed by the Discourse Processing Lab at Simon Fraser University.

The Quotation tool uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to extract quotes from large (or small) text datasets, all from the comfort of a web browser. The tool can identify from the sentence "Apple said that Tim Cook will be in Australia next month." the phrase "Tim Cook will be in Australia next month" as the quote and "Apple" as the speaker. It also allows users to extract and visualise additional information right in the web browser, including identifying named entities affiliated with the speakers and in the quotes themselves, such as "Apple", "Tim Cook" and "Australia" in the above example. The tool supports saving the results locally for further analysis, enabling you to gain meaningful insights into your research questions.

This 1-hour online workshop will be of interest to researchers and HDR students in Linguistics, Business, Law and Science and others who are interested in working with text datasets - no background knowledge of NLP or coding experience is required.

You can BYO a small dataset (10-15 texts, stored as one text per file or all texts compressed in a zip file) – or use one of our sample datasets to get started.

The workshop is presented by the [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/o/sydney-informatics-hub-core-research-facilities-dvcr-the-university-of-sydney-10505148868).

**Date**: September 8 2022 <br>
**Time**: 12:00 - 13:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time <br>

#### Showcasing Approaches to Digital Humanities for Researchers: Advance care planning for your research data

Sometimes research projects can feel never ending, but in fact most projects do have a finish point (such as submitting a thesis). What then happens to the data collected in the project? This workshop starts from that question, invites participants to consider possible answers and then to think about the implications for their current data management practices. We consider the practical, ethical, and technical dimensions of managing research data after the project ends to help participants to start planning for the future of their data.

The workshop is presented by the [FAVeR](https://faver.edu.au/).

**Date**: September 7 2022 <br>
**Time**: 12:00 - 13:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time <br>
**[Details and Registration](https://faver.edu.au/event/advance-care-planning-for-your-research-data/)**

### Office Hours {#office-hours}

We invite Australian researchers working with linguistics, text analytics, digital and computational methods, social media and web archives, and much more to attend our regular online office hours, jointly hosted with the [Digital Observatory](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/). Bring your technical questions, research problems and rough ideas and get advice and feedback from the combined expertise of our ARDC research infrastructure projects. No question is too small, and even if we don’t know the answer we are likely to be able to point you to someone who does.

These sessions run over Zoom from 2-3pm (Australia/Sydney time) every second Tuesday - [details](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/office-hours/).
