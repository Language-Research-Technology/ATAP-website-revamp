### Webinars

Our webinar series is a joint initiative with the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory ([LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)), (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Queensland). LADAL sponsored [webinars](https://slcladal.github.io/webinars2022.html) take place in the alternate months.

All webinars take place at 8:00PM Brisbane time which is UTC+10. Zoom links will be available one week prior to the event.

#### 4 April 2022 - Keoni Mahelona: A practical approach to Indigenous data sovereignty
Keoni Mahelona is the Chief Technical Officer of [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/) where he is a part of the team developing the Kaitiakitanga Licence. This licence seeks to balance the importance of publicly accessible data with the reality that indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public data. By simply opening access to data and knowledge, indigenous people could be further colonised and taken advantage of in a digital, modern world. Therefore Keoni is committed to devising data governance regimes which enable Indigenous people to reclaim and maintain sovereignty over indigenous data.

#### June 6 2022 - Barbara McGillivray: The *Journal of Open Humanities Data*
Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and Editor in Chief of the [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/). Since September 2021 she is also a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the [Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh). Before joining the Turing, she was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature. Her research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. She works on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). Her interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic.

#### October 3 2022 - Paweł Kamocki: [topic tba]
Paweł Kamocki is a legal expert in Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim. He studied linguistics and law, and in 2017 obtained his doctorate in law from the universities of Paris and Münster for a thesis on legal aspects of data-intensive university research, with a focus on Knowledge Commons. He worked as a research and teaching assistant at the Paris Descartes university (now: Université de Paris), then also in the private sector. He is certified to work as an attorney in France. An active member of the [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) community since 2012, he currently chairs the CLARIN Legal and Ethical Issues Committee. He also worked with other projects and initiatives in the field of research data policy (RDA, EUDAT) and co-created several LegalTech tools for researchers. One of his main research interests are legal issues in Machine Translation.

### Office Hours

We invite Australian researchers working with linguistics, text analytics, digital and computational methods, social media and web archives, and much more to attend our regular online office hours, jointly hosted with the [Digital Observatory](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/). Bring your technical questions, research problems and rough ideas and get advice and feedback from the combined expertise of our ARDC research infrastructure projects. No question is too small, and even if we don’t know the answer we are likely to be able to point you to someone who does.

These sessions run over Zoom from 2-3pm (Australia/Sydney time) every second Tuesday - [details](https://research.qut.edu.au/digitalobservatory/office-hours/).
