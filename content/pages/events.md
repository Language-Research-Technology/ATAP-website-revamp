### Webinars {#webinars}

Our webinar series is a joint initiative with the Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory ([LADAL](https://slcladal.github.io/index.html)), (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Queensland). LADAL sponsored [webinars](https://slcladal.github.io/webinars2022.html) take place in the alternate months.

All webinars take place at 8:00PM Brisbane time which is UTC+10. Zoom links will be available one week prior to the event.

#### 4 April 2022 - Keoni Mahelona: A practical approach to Indigenous data sovereignty
Keoni Mahelona is the Chief Technical Officer of [Te Hiku Media](https://tehiku.nz/) where he is a part of the team developing the Kaitiakitanga Licence. This licence seeks to balance the importance of publicly accessible data with the reality that indigenous peoples may not have access to the resources that enable them to benefit from public data. By simply opening access to data and knowledge, indigenous people could be further colonised and taken advantage of in a digital, modern world. Therefore Keoni is committed to devising data governance regimes which enable Indigenous people to reclaim and maintain sovereignty over indigenous data.

#### June 6 2022 - Barbara McGillivray: The *Journal of Open Humanities Data*
Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), and Editor in Chief of the [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/). Since September 2021 she is also a lecturer in Digital Humanities and Cultural Computation at the [Department of Digital Humanities of King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh). Before joining the Turing, she was language technologist in the Dictionary division of Oxford University Press and data scientist in the Open Research Group of Springer Nature. Her research at the Turing is on how words change meaning over time and how to model this change in computational ways. She works on machine-learning models for the change in meaning of words in historical times (Ancient Greek, Latin, eighteen-century English) and in contemporary texts (Twitter, web archives, emoji). Her interdisciplinary contribution covers Data Science, Natural Language Processing, Historical Linguistics and other humanistic fields, to push the boundaries of what academic disciplines separately have achieved so far on this topic.

#### August 1 2022 - Václav Cvrček: The Czech national Corpus
[Václav Cvrček](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/institute/people/vaclav-cvrcek-2/) is a linguist who deals with the description of the Czech language, especially with the use of large electronic corpora and quantitative methods. In 2013-2016 he worked as the director of the [Czech National Corpus](https://ucnk.ff.cuni.cz/en/) project, since 2016 he has been the deputy director. Recently, he has been focusing on research on textual variability and corpus-based discourse analysis with a focus on online media.

#### October 3 2022 - Paweł Kamocki: [topic tba]
Paweł Kamocki is a legal expert in Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache, Mannheim. He studied linguistics and law, and in 2017 obtained his doctorate in law from the universities of Paris and Münster for a thesis on legal aspects of data-intensive university research, with a focus on Knowledge Commons. He worked as a research and teaching assistant at the Paris Descartes university (now: Université de Paris), then also in the private sector. He is certified to work as an attorney in France. An active member of the [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) community since 2012, he currently chairs the CLARIN Legal and Ethical Issues Committee. He also worked with other projects and initiatives in the field of research data policy (RDA, EUDAT) and co-created several LegalTech tools for researchers. One of his main research interests are legal issues in Machine Translation.

### Forthcoming workshops {#forthcoming-workshops}

#### Geolocating Australian Historical Resources

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using places featured in archival material and other digitised textual resources as the basis for visualisation and spatial analysis. Natural Language Processing (NLP) software, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), facilitates the automated identification and extraction of geographic locations from text; however, it cannot assign or resolve geographic coordinates. The process of manually identifying coordinates for individual locations can be time consuming and is impractical when working with large corpora. This workshop will introduce participants to the basic principles of geolocation, the process through which geographic coordinates are linked with place names, as well as demonstrating approaches and workflows that can assist in automating this task.
Taking the classic Australian text For the Term of his Natural Life (1874) as the object of analysis, this workshop will also provide participants with a critical understanding of the affordances and limitations of these tools.
This workshop will provide participants with the following skills and competencies:
- The ability to identify and extract locations from text through the application of off the shelf Named Entity Recognition Software
- The ability to identify the appropriate gazetteer (record of place names) for their research, and an understanding of how these records can be employed in a computational approach to automate the task of geo-location.
- The ability to transform geo-located data into maps through the use of basic mapping software.
- An understanding of the limitations of NER software, and the ability to recognise and understand how different approaches may impact the accuracy of the data.
- A practical understanding of how this approach can be automated. An example of this workflow as applied to For the Term of his Natural Life will be made accessible to participants in the form of a freely distributed Jupyter notebook
This workshop is of relevance to anyone interested in the practical and theoretical challenges of geolocating Australian historical resources, and welcomes individuals with or without programming experience.
