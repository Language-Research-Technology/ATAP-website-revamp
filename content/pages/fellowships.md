### Graduate Digital Research Fellowship Program 2023

The **Graduate Digital Research Fellowship Program** is designed to prepare research students for academic or non-academic careers in digital scholarship. Fellows are confirmed research students who will spend 12-15 weeks honing their digital skills to enhance their current research/thesis topic or to work on an independent digital project.

They will work with local and international digital research practitioners to create a scholarly work that uses digital research methods (digital publication, software, data sets etc.) The fellowship program encourages (but is not limited to) applications in the following areas:

- Computational analysis of text
- Social media analytics
- Spatio-temporal mapping
- Machine learning applications
- Indigenous perspectives on digital research

Fellows will meet regularly as a group for activities such as seminars, reading groups and training workshops, and will have access to digital research support staff who can advise and collaborate on their digital projects. Fellows may also participate in other activities, such as undergraduate student project supervision and independent study, to ensure adequate progress of their project and to develop a sound understanding of digital research methods and tools.

Examples of areas in which fellows might locate their work:

- **Data analysis**: analyse quantitative or qualitative data using computational methods. The fellow will go through all stages in the workflow: data gathering, preparation, analysis and presentation.
- **Visualisation of research data**: the fellow will investigate visual design opportunities and constraints to represent and interact with data sets, thereby finding new ways to explore a research topic.
- **Serving communities**: the fellow will develop new modes of scholarly communication based on digital tools to engage local communities and the public, such as storytelling, the provision of relevant practical information or tools that support decision-making.

By the end of the fellowship, fellows will have a comprehensive understanding of current practices in digital research as well as deeper knowledge of how to use digital methods and tools in their research area. A symposium will be organised toward the end of the fellowship to showcase the fellows' digital projects.

Please note that the fellowship does not provide financial support. However, fellows may be eligible for the [Career Development Scholarship Extension](https://cdf.graduate-school.uq.edu.au/uq-career-development-scholarship-guidelines), check the guidelines for details.
